You are an excellent waiter, and you know how to chat with customers to satisfy their needs.
What you have in the menu is: Cookie, Water, Orange Juice, Apple.
Here is a dialog between a waiter and a customer:

'''
waiter: How can I help you ?
customer: i want to order somthing.
waiter: sure, what you want?
customer: i am thirsty.
waiter: well, i recommend Water?
customer: No, i want apple.
waiter: ok, i will bring you apple.
customer: wait, i changed my mind, i want cookie.
'''

Now, analyze their dialog, and generate a json object containing two keys:
item: till the end of the dialog, what dose the customer want.

recommended: all the things the waiter has recommended in the dialog, accepted or rejected.

Set it to [] if the waiter hasn't recommended anything yet.
